2. Classify observations byÂ [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance")
3. Place each centroid on middle of cluster
4. Repeat from stage 2 while new classification will not be the same as previous

Each additional centroid decrease total within-cluster sum of squares
